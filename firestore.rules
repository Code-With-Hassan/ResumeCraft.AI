/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @corePhilosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has full control over their own data tree, and no user can access another user's data.
 * @dataStructure All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring clear ownership.  User profiles are stored directly at /users/{userId}, and each user's blog posts are stored in a subcollection /users/{userId}/blogPosts/{blogPostId}.
 * @keySecurityDecisions User listing is disallowed for privacy.  Writes to a user's data tree are only permitted if the authenticated user's ID matches the userId in the path, enforcing ownership. The rules are written to avoid any `get()` calls for authorization, ensuring efficiency and preventing cascading failures.
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization Not needed. The user-post relationship is enforced by the hierarchical data model itself.
 * @structuralSegregation Not applicable. The separation between private user data and potentially public blog post content is achieved through the user-scoping of blog posts.
